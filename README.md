# java-coding-shortcuts package

So using this package, some basic components like for loop, while loop etc can be quickly accessed. As we know that in java we have to write long syntax. How about we just write a small word and this package could complete the rest.
These are the shortcuts that are available in this package.

1. fr : stands for for loop with variable i.
2. fr <var> : stands for for loop with variable <var>.
3. ie : stands for if else syntax.
4. iec : stands for a else if component.
5. wh : stands for while loop.
6. pl <something> : stands for System.out.println(something);.
7. p <something> : stands for System.out.print(something);.
8. main : automatically creates a main function with args as the arguments.

To use these shortcuts, simply write the shortcut e.g. fr. Then select this portion, write click and select fetch java-coding-shortcuts, or use the shortcut key after selection.
